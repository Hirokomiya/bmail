# bmail
How to use

1:Copy and paste the code on 
remix
Or
Ethereum Wallet
Or
Truffle

2:Connect to metamask, it works with both mainnet and testnet

Alternatively
You can deploy "At Address" with this contract address 0xdd583e1577e202720ab84172aac04e1d1768c57f
You don't have to pay GAS since I already deployed. 

Click "bmail" insert eth address in "to" box and message in "message" box to send

Check Index_inbox to see if you have any message. It shows you numbers. Shows nothing if no message

If you have any message and you will see the number. 
Go to inbox and type the number to open the message

same logic to "sent" function

Send me a message to
0x6CD1B82490Eb7aA18beC4305C6c2E691194C6898

You can set gwei to 2 for cheaper transaction and still works. It is 3 as default.
